Clash Language User Guide
=========================

Welcome to the Clash Language User Guide, the official documentation of the
`Clash Compiler`_. Clash is an open-source functional hardware description
language (HDL) that borrows syntax and semantics from the `Haskell`_
programming language. To learn more, we suggest reading the
:ref:`introduction to Clash <intro>`.

.. _`Clash Compiler`: https://clash-lang.org
.. _`Haskell`: https://www.haskell.org

The table of contents below (and in the sidebar) allows easy access to
different pages in the documentation. You can also use the search function in
the top left corner.

.. note:: The Clash Compiler and Clash Language User Guide are open-source
  efforts developed by QBayLogic B.V. and other volunteers. The Clash Team
  always appreciates feedback and contributions to the project to help improve
  the development experience.

  If you don't understand something, or think something is missing or incorrect
  in the documentation you can open an issue or pull request in the
  `GitHub repository`_.
